████, many thanks for the invitation to speak at the the conference outlined 
below.  Believe it or not, I'm already committed to be out of the country on 
the dates of the conference, so I'll have to decline.  I do appreciate the 
offer, though.

It was nice hearing from you.  Take care, ████

████, next October 23, 24, 25 in Laguna Niguel, Texas Pacific is hosting
their annual  portfolio company CEO conference (about 50 CEO;s in
attendance).  TPG ( a client of mine), you may know, is a premier private
equity investor--known best perhaps for Continental Airlines or if you ride
motorcycles Ducati,. $10billion in funds investment and good guys, you may
have met ███ ███████, or █████ █████████ or ████ █████, the senior
partners. They love to have you as their keynote speaker and I think it
would be worth your while.  Let me know if it works or whether I can
connect you up with them directly. I hope all is going well and
congratulations on your formal recognition as CEO.. Cheers ████  P.S. █████
███████ mentioned to me a couple of weeks ago that his meeting with you
last year was "one of the most influential ██'s had"

CEO Conference





████ --

As we discussed by voicemail, it would be great if you could connect with
████ ████████ to see if ██ would be interested in speaking at the TPG CEO
conference on the topic of Growth. ████████ sent over to ████ a copy of our
growth pamphlet, which ██ may also wish to use at the conference.  Enron is
featured prominently in the pamphlet as a great example of a growth story.

By way of background for ████, TPG has combined funds of well over $10
billion under management including its most recent $4.5 billion fund.
Their investments are loosely split between telecom, high tech, Europe and
all other.  They also have partial interests in a number of specialty funds
including Newbridge (Asia and Latin American), ████ (water-related
investments), Colony (real estate), Gryphon (early stage, growth) and a
number of others including newly created venture and crossover funds.
There will be over 50 CEOs at their conference, including Continental
Airlines, America West, Del Monte, Beringer, Ducati, Bally, and a host of
others.

I can't remember the exact date for the conference, but I think ████
mentioned the fall time frame.

Please let me/████ know if ████ would be interested in speaking with ████
further.
